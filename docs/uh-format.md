# Universal Hex Format

The micro:bit Universal Hex format is a superset of the
[Intel Hex file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX) designed to be
able to include data for multiple targets into a single file.
This allows the creation of a hex file that will work on micro:bit V1 and V2.

Detailed information of the Universal Hex format can be found in the
specification:
